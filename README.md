Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (Transformers.ipynb) that demonstrates the use of Hugging Face Transformers with PyTorch. It covers:

1. Installing and setting up dependencies.

2. Using pretrained transformer models for NLP tasks.

3. Tokenization, embedding extraction, and pipeline demonstrations.

4.Working with datasets and evaluation tools.

5. Fine-tuning and inference workflows (if included in later cells).


Notebook Structure

1. Setup & Installation

Installs required libraries and suppresses warnings.

Sets random seeds for reproducibility.

2. Pretrained Pipelines

Demonstrates Hugging Face pipeline API (e.g., fill-mask).

3. Tokenizer & Embeddings

Uses BertTokenizer and BertModel to convert text into embeddings.

4. Datasets & Evaluation (Later Cells)

Loads datasets via datasets library.

Prepares evaluation metrics with evaluate.

5. Fine-Tuning / Training (If implemented)

Defines model training loops with PyTorch.

Uses Trainer API for supervised tasks.

6. Inference & Applications

Runs predictions on new text inputs.

Key Features

1.End-to-end transformer workflow demonstration.

2. Multilingual model support via sentencepiece.

3. Reproducibility through consistent random seeds.

4. Extendable for classification, translation, summarization, or question answering tasks.
